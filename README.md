# Final evaluation - module 1

Hey ðŸ‘‹! I share with you my first module's final evaluation at Adalab. The challenge was **create a website with a specific design** and using some tool, like:
- Sass;
- Flexbox and CSS Grid;
- Media query;
- Transitions.

> **NOTE:** For this project, I'd use Adalab Starter Kit with template engine and pre-installed features.
